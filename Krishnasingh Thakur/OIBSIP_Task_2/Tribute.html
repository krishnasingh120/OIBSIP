            <p>
                Vint Cerf's Internet work is not yet
                done. The Interplanetary Internet
                will require new protocols, notes
                for which cover his whiteboard in
                Google's offices in Reston,Va <br>
                There are other Internets to be archi-
                tected. Cerf points to his office white-
                board, where a scrawled diagram looks
                something like a complicated version of
                that first sketch for the Internet. The diagram is part
                of the design-in-progress for the Interplanetary
                Internet, an effort to connect a future Internet on
                the moon, other planets, and traveling space probes
                to one another and the terrestrial Internet. <br>
                “It requires a different set of protocols,” Cerf
                explains, “because TCP is not designed to do flow
                control with a 40-minute round trip. The problem
                gets worse when you go to the outer planets. Instead
                of minutes, it’s hours or even days. And the planets
                are rotating, disrupting communication. So we had
                to develop delay-and-disruption-tolerant network-
                ing, a protocol we now call the Bundle Protocol
                Suite.” Cerf has been working on the Interplanetary
                Internet since 1998; the effort has grown from a
                handful of people to hundreds today. <br>
                “Patience and persistence,” Cerf says. That’s
                been his motto throughout his career. “I’m not going
                to see the end of this. I feel like I’m in chapter two
                of what will be a much longer story about the history
                of interplanetary networking.” <br>
                Then there is the Interspecies Internet, an
                effort launched in 2007 by Cerf; Diana Reiss,
                director of the animal behavior and conservation
                graduate programs at Hunter College, in New York
                City; Neil Gershenfeld, director of MIT’s Center
                for Bits and Atoms; and musician Peter Gabriel.
                This global think tank now has more than 4,500
                members and is looking to AI to help translate the
                signals from one species into those that other
                species can understand. <br>
                “It’s been a slow process,” Cerf says, “but it’s like
                all my other projects—it might take decades.
                “I feel like Lewis and Clark, wandering in a land-
                scape full of ideas and endless frontiers. Software,
                and therefore computer communication, simply has
                no limits. You never know what you are going to
                turn up next.”
